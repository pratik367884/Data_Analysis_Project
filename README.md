# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow on an e-commerce dataset, leveraging both **SQL** and **Python** tools. It involves extracting data from a SQL database, performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing insights using popular Python libraries.

The project was inspired by a comprehensive YouTube tutorial and expanded with additional problem-solving exercises to deepen understanding.

## Files Included

- **Ecommerce.ipynb**  
  Connects Python to a SQL database to extract relevant e-commerce data using queries. Demonstrates SQL concepts such as `JOIN`, filtering, and aggregation within Python using libraries like `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`.

- **Questions.ipynb**  
  Contains a series of data analysis questions and their solutions implemented in Python. This notebook focuses on data manipulation with Pandas, handling missing data, and producing visualizations to uncover business insights.

- **Ecommerce_Dataset_Link.txt**  
  Provides the source link to the original dataset used for the analysis, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL** (for data extraction and querying)  
- **Python**  
  - Pandas (data manipulation)  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)  
  - Jupyter Notebook (interactive development environment)

## Key Features

- Extracting and querying datasets from a SQL database directly into Python notebooks  
- Data cleaning: handling missing values, data type conversions, and data reshaping  
- Exploratory data analysis to identify trends, outliers, and key business metrics  
- Visualizing data through bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps  
- Documenting solutions to specific business questions for clarity and learning
